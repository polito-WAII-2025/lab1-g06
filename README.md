# How to run 

## Inside the IntelliJ IDE 

In order to run the application the working directory has to be set to `./RouteAnalyzer` since the app will look for  a
`./evaluation` folder to load the `custom-parameter.yml`

## As Jar file 
Place the `custom-parameters.yml` inside a `./evaluation` directory in the same directory as the jar file

## As a Docker container 
After having built the jar 
- `docker build -t . routeanalyzer` 
- `docker-compose up`
